## v2

Mockspresso2 is a pure kotlin rewrite of [Mockspresso](https://episode6.github.io/mockspresso). While reflection is
still used to create objects (we now use kotlin-reflect), annotation processing has been dropped in favor of kotlin's
delegated properties. See the [Translation Guide](TRANSLATION_GUIDE.md) for key differences.
